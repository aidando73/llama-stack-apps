Developers are always expected to ensure that their deployments, including those that involve additional languages, are completed safely and responsibly.\n\nLlama 3.2 Model Family: Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All model versions use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\n\nModel Release Date: Oct 24, 2024\n\nStatus: This is a static model trained on an offline dataset.

Instruction tuned text only models are intended for assistant-like chat and agentic applications like knowledge retrieval and summarization, mobile AI powered writing assistants and query and prompt rewriting. Pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of additional natural language generation tasks. Similarly, quantized models can be adapted for a variety of on-device use-cases with limited compute resources.\n\nOut of Scope: Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3.2 Community License. Use in languages beyond those explicitly referenced as supported in this model card.\n\n## Hardware and Software\n\nTraining Factors: We used custom training libraries, Meta's custom built GPU cluster, and production infrastructure for pretraining.
